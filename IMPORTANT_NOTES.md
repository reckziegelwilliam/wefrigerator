# ‚ö†Ô∏è wefrigerator - Important Notes - Read Before Starting

## Critical Setup Steps

### 1. Environment Variables
Before running the app, you MUST create `.env.local`:

\`\`\`bash
cp .env.example .env.local
\`\`\`

Then add your Supabase credentials:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - from Supabase Settings ‚Üí API
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - from Supabase Settings ‚Üí API

### 2. Database Migrations
Run ALL THREE migrations in Supabase SQL Editor IN ORDER:

1. `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` (creates tables)
2. `supabase/migrations/002_rls_policies.sql` (security)
3. `supabase/migrations/003_storage_buckets.sql` (photo storage)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Don't skip any migrations or change the order!**

### 3. First Admin User
After signing up:

1. Sign in to the app with your email
2. Go to Supabase dashboard ‚Üí Table Editor ‚Üí `profile`
3. Find your user row
4. Change `role` column from `'contributor'` to `'admin'`
5. Refresh the app

**Without this step, you won't be able to access admin features!**

## Common Gotchas

### ‚ùå Magic Links Not Working
**Problem:** Can't sign in, links don't work

**Solution:**
1. Check Supabase ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí URL Configuration
2. Add your domain to "Redirect URLs":
   - Local: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
   - Production: `https://your-domain.com/auth/callback`

### ‚ùå Photos Not Uploading
**Problem:** Upload button doesn't work

**Solution:**
1. Verify storage bucket exists: Supabase ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí `photos`
2. Make sure bucket is PUBLIC
3. Check file is under 3MB
4. Use JPG, PNG, or WebP format only

### ‚ùå Map Not Showing
**Problem:** Blank map on home page

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you have at least one fridge in the database
2. Check fridge has valid `lat` and `lng` coordinates
3. Look for JavaScript errors in browser console

### ‚ùå Permission Denied Errors
**Problem:** "permission denied" or "not authorized" errors

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you ran migration `002_rls_policies.sql`
2. Verify you're signed in (check for user in top right)
3. Check your role in the `profile` table
4. Clear browser cache and try again

### ‚ùå Build Fails
**Problem:** `npm run build` shows errors

**Solution:**
1. Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`
2. Run `npm install` again
3. Run `npm run type-check` to find TypeScript errors
4. Make sure `.env.local` exists (even with dummy values for build)

## Security Warnings

### üîí Never Commit Secrets
- `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` - keep it there!
- Never commit Supabase keys to Git
- Use Vercel environment variables for production

### üîí Use Anon Key Only
- Frontend should ONLY use `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- NEVER use Service Role Key in frontend code
- Service Role Key bypasses RLS - dangerous!

### üîí Row Level Security
- All tables have RLS enabled
- Don't disable RLS in production
- Test with different user roles

## Performance Tips

### üöÄ Image Optimization
- Photos are auto-resized to 1200x1200
- EXIF data is stripped for privacy
- Keep original under 3MB for best UX

### üöÄ Database Queries
- Status queries are indexed by `fridge_id` and `created_at`
- Limit results to avoid slow queries
- Use pagination for large lists (future enhancement)

### üöÄ Map Loading
- Map loads Leaflet CSS dynamically
- First load might be slower
- Consider adding a loading state (future enhancement)

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
\`\`\`bash
npm run dev          # Start dev server with hot reload
npm run type-check   # Check TypeScript errors
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run build        # Test production build
\`\`\`

### Before Committing
1. Run `npm run type-check` - should pass with no errors
2. Test key features manually
3. Check for console errors
4. Review changes in Git

### Before Deploying
1. Test build: `npm run build`
2. Review environment variables
3. Check Supabase migrations are applied
4. Test auth flow end-to-end
5. Verify admin account exists
